# TPU traffic classifier

**Use at your own risk: While this is tested to work well, it's early stage software used for testing and experiments.**

This small program creates ipsets and iptables rules for nodes in the Solana network. 

By default, it creates and maintains the following ipsets:

 - `solana-gossip`: all ips visible in gossip
 - `solana-unstaked`: unstaked nodes visible in gossip
 - `solana-staked`: staked nodes visible in gossip
 - `solana-high-staked`: nodes visible in gossip with >1% of stake

These sets will be kept up to date for as long as this software runs. On exit it will clean up the sets.

You can modify these categories by editing `config.yml`, setting the minimum stake percentages for each category. The validator will be placed in the largest category that applies to it.

It also uses the PREROUTING tables to permanently mark traffic from these sets of IPs on the local nodes . This can be used in later traffic rules. By default the following fwmarks are set:

 - `1`: unstaked
 - `3`: staked
 - `9`: high staked

If you provide you validator pubkey it will assume that your validator runs on localhost and it will lookup the TPU port of the validator and enable the firwalling rules. If you do not provide your validator pubkey, all UDP traffic passing through this host will be passed through the chains created by this tool.

##  Running

Run: `go run .`

Build: `go build -o tpu-traffic-classifier .`

```
$ ./tpu-traffic-classifier --help
Usage of ./tpu-traffic-classifier:
  -config-file string
        configuration file (default "config.yml")
  -pubkey string
        validator-pubkey
  -rpc-uri string
        the rpc uri to use (default "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com")
```

## Traffic shaping

**Incomplete example, not usable as-is**

You can use the fwmarks set by this tool to create traffic classes for QoS/traffic shaping.


```
tc qdisc add dev eth0 handle 1: ingress

tc filter add dev eth0 protocol ip parent 1: prio 1 handle 1 fw flowid 1:10 police rate 100mbit burst 100k # unstaked
tc filter add dev eth0 protocol ip parent 1: prio 1 handle 3 fw flowid 1:20 # staked
tc filter add dev eth0 protocol ip parent 1: prio 1 handle 9 fw flowid 1:30 # high staked
tc filter add dev eth0 protocol ip parent 1: prio 1 handle 6 fw flowid 1:40 # others
```

## Firewalling

**If you do not provide a validator pubkey, then all UDP traffic will pass through these firewall rules**.

You can add rules to `solana-tpu-custom` (or `solana-tpu-custom-vote`, `solana-tpu-custom-fwd`). This chain will persist between invocations of this tool (it's not cleaned out). If you provide your validator pubkey, then the tool will look up your TPU port and send all incoming UDP TPU traffic to this port to the `solana-tpu-custom` chain.

For instance if you wanted to temporarily close TPU ports you can run:

```
iptables -A solana-tpu-custom -j DROP
```

This will drop all traffic to the tpu port.

If you would like to drop all traffic to TPU port apart from validators (staked nodes):

```
iptables -A solana-tpu-custom -m set --match-set solana-staked src -j ACCEPT
iptables -A solana-tpu-custom -m set --match-set solana-high-staked src -j ACCEPT
iptables -A solana-tpu-custom -j DROP
```

If you would only allow nodes in gossip to send to your TPU:

```
iptables -A solana-tpu-custom -m set --match-set solana-gossip src -j ACCEPT
iptables -A solana-tpu-custom -j DROP
```

Log all traffic from nodes not in gossip to you TPU fwd:

```
iptables -A solana-tpu-custom-fwd -m set ! --match-set solana-gossip src -j LOG --log-prefix 'TPUfwd:not in gossip:' --log-level info
```

These rules will only work when this utility is running. When it is not running, the TPU port will be open as usual.

## Example iptables generated

The examples below is generated by this tool when run with the `pubkey` param for a valid validator. When the tool exits it will clean these rules up with the exception of `-custom...`  if (and only if) it's not empty.

```
